                    <h3>"The Smell of Markers and Solana's Rise"</h3>
                    <p>That day, Petrov exhaled the phrase: "$HA! will fly." No one believed him. He covered himself with markers, stood on a desk, and shouted "I am a candle!"</p>
                    <p>At that moment, Solana started to rise. The teachers wrote it off as a coincidence. But we knew — he was connected to the VHS-god.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="episode">
                    <h3>"The PE Teacher and Tokenization of Vaulting Horse Jumps"</h3>
                    <p>When the school introduced NFT-jumps, the PE teacher began minting every successful jump. Student Lyokha became a whale in one day because he did a somersault. Now he doesn't go to school, he just writes "$HA!" in Telegram and everyone understands.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="episode">
                    <h3>"Blockchain Test"</h3>
                    <p>The math test was stored in a smart contract. Those who failed were sent to gas fee limbo. One excellent student accidentally bricked the contract — now he's the admin of the entire school. His name is Vitya. He no longer talks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="episode">
                    <h3>"Who Erased the Yeralash VHS?"</h3>
                    <p>Someone erased all episodes of Yeralash in the school media library and replaced them with stock charts. Students think it was the vice-principal. He now walks around in a bull costume whispering "Bull trend..."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="episode">
                    <h3>"The Floppy Disk That Contained $HA!"</h3>
                    <p>One day, due to a power outage, the computer science teacher pulled out an old floppy disk. There was a $HA! smart contract on it. He said: "This is where it all began." Everyone sat in silence. Even the projector started smoking.</p>
